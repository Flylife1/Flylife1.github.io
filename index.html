            It's been two years since I decided to go back to school. There have been a lot of obstacles but I am definitely happy
            with my decision.  You see, a couple of years ago I was bartending when a friend of mine popped in, who I hadn't seen in
            years. We talked about what she had been up to and it turned out she needed a graphic designer for a project she was working on.
            Naturally, I offered my services and after she saw the work and approved, she paid me! But, that wasn't all. She needed a website.
            Like an idiot, I told her I could do it. I didn't have any experience whatsoever but I was always intrigued. So,
            I followed some tutorials and made my first website. It was horrible, but it was mine. Like an ugly first born child that only 
            you see the beauty in.  Anyway, I decided to go back to school to finish my graphic
            design degree and delve more into the world of web programming
